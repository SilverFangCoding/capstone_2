# Personal Web
My personal website with CSS and Bootstrap.

This is an exercise for Angela Yu's Web development course.

Designed by me in "Canva" and replicated from scratch in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as an exercise to practice CSS and bootstrap.

Approach: mobile first (320x550 Viewport), then made responsive for desktop and higher resolutions, including ultrawide monitors.

Link of X/Twitter in footer not working as it is yet to be created, using placeholder instead.
